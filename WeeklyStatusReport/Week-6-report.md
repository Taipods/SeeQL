> Talk about moving forward in terms of features

Reminder
--------
> Finish features by Monday
>
> Please start code reviewing each other's work

Issues
------
> Composite keys are a limitation, I can't - James
>
> UI that has a db with empty tables. The tables that has attributes with it, will be the one shown up when nothing is there.
>
> Mermaid.js is limiting the amount of css that we can do towards it. Which kind of sucks. I wanted to make the tables movable. Life is not good.
>
> SQL to database. It needs to be basic because SQLite only takes basic SQL queries.
>
> Non-composite queries were bad and between was not generated in Relational - Elio - Fixed
>
> Takes a long time to process a query that is generated
